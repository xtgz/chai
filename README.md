# CHAI

inspiration [here](https://github.com/vbelz/Data-pipeline-twitter)

this is an attempt at an open-source data pipeline, from which we can build our app that
ranks open-source projects. all pieces for this are managed by `docker-compose`. there
are 3 services to it:

1. db: postgres to store package specific data
1. alembic: for running migrations
1. pipeline: which fetches and writes data

## Setup

first run `mkdir -p data/{crates,pkgx,homebrew,npm,pypi,rubys}`, to setup the data
directory where the fetchers will store the data.

then, running `docker compose up` will setup the db and run the pipeline. a successful
run will look something like this:

```

```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> the `PKG_MANAGER` argument denotes which package manager the pipeline will be run for
> it is configurable, and defaults to `crates`

> [!TIP]
>
> to force it, `docker-compose up --force-recreate --build`

## Hard Reset

if at all you need to do a hard reset, here's the steps

1. `rm -rf db/data`: removes all the data that was loaded into the db
1. `rm -rf .venv`: if you created a virtual environment for local dev, this removes it
1. `rm -rf data`: removes all the data the fetcher is putting
1. `docker system prune -a -f --volumes`: removes **everything** docker-related

> [!WARNING]
>
> step 4 deletes all your docker stuff...be careful

<!-- this is handled now that alembic/psycopg2 are in pkgx -->
<!--
## Alembic Alternatives

- sqlx command line tool to manage migrations, alongside models for sqlx in rust
- vapor's migrations are written in swift
-->

## Usage

our goal is to build a data schema that looks like this:

<!-- ![db/CHAI_ERD.png](db/CHAI_ERD.png) -->

our specific application extracts the dependency graph understand what are critical
pieces of the open-source graph. there are many other potential use cases for this data:

- impacts of a package update (is it compatible with other packages)
- finding name squats
- finding the superpower maintainers
- number of versions / releases per package, and a release cadence
- ...

### top packages by number of versions

```sql
SELECT p."name", count(v."version") AS total_versions
FROM packages p
JOIN versions v ON p.id = v.package_id
GROUP BY p."name"
ORDER BY total_versions DESC;
```

### some creative ways to detect name squats

```sql
SELECT left(p."name", 5), count(1) as number_of_packages
FROM packages p
GROUP BY left(p."name", 5)
ORDER BY number_of_packages DESC;
```

### url types available

```sql
SELECT ut."name", count(1)
FROM package_urls pu
JOIN url_types ut ON pu.url_type_id = ut.id
GROUP BY ut."name";
```

### what platform is most used for code hosting?

```sql
SELECT
	CASE
		WHEN u.url ~ 'github' AND ut."name" = 'repository' THEN 'GitHub'
		WHEN u.url ~ 'gitlab' AND ut."name" = 'repository' THEN 'GitLab'
		ELSE 'Other'
	END,
	count(1)
FROM package_urls pu
JOIN urls u ON pu.url_id = u.id
JOIN packages p ON pu.package_id = p.id
JOIN url_types ut ON ut.id = pu.url_type_id
WHERE ut."name" = 'repository'
GROUP BY
	CASE
		WHEN u.url ~ 'github' AND ut."name" = 'repository' THEN 'GitHub'
		WHEN u.url ~ 'gitlab' AND ut."name" = 'repository' THEN 'GitLab'
		ELSE 'Other'
	END;
```

### packages where we're missing repo urls

```sql
SELECT p."name"
FROM packages p
LEFT JOIN package_urls pu ON p.id = pu.package_id AND pu.url_type_id = (
    SELECT id FROM url_types WHERE "name" = 'repository'
)
WHERE pu.id IS NULL;
```

## FAQs / common issues

1. the database url is `postgresql://postgres:s3cr3t@localhost:5435/chai`, and is used
   as `CHAI_DATABASE_URL` in the environment.
1. there are two bash scripts use by the alembic and pipeline services, and you'd need
   to run the following to ensure they can be executed:
   ```sh
   chmod +x alembic/run_migrations.sh
   chmod +x src/run_pipeline.sh
   ```

## tasks

these are tasks that can be run using xcfile.dev. if you have pkgx, just run `dev` to
inject into your environment. if you don't...go get it.
